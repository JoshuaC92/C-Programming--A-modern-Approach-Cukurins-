The following is a repository i have created with the following
goals in mind:

	1. Document my C programming learning journey
	2. Show off my C programming style and understanding
	3. Lifting up my Git and GitHub use

This Repo contains source code to answer most of the programming questions
at the end of each chapter in the book "C Programming: A Modern Approach".

I welcome any and all communications and contributions to this repo as well
as any other ideas people may wish to share!

Cheers
Josh
